Daily Selfie
=====

An Android application that maintains an album of photos or ‘selfies’ of a user. The user clicks a picture every day, which is stored by the app. At any point of time, the user can see the pictures clicked before to see the change in their appearance over time. This application was developed towards completion of the “Programming Mobile Applications for Android Handheld Systems” MOOC conducted University Of Maryland, College Park through Coursera.
